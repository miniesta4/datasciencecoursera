## Map of Navarredondilla

This is the map of a very small village called Navarredondilla, 
located in the Alberche Valley, province of √Åvila, Spain.  
The icon is the village's coat of arms. Beautiful in my opinion.  
The link goes to the web site of a weather station located at the center of village.   
Today is quite chilly up there.   
It is not bad for such a small village (200 inhabitants) to have this two things.  
I hope you like it.

```{r nav, echo=FALSE}
navIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "/home/miniesta4/Pictures/Navarredondilla.JPG", 
  iconWidth = 50, iconHeight = 50,
  iconAnchorX = 50, iconAnchorY = 50
)

navSite <- "<a href='http://www.navarredondilla.info'>El tiempo en Navarredondilla</a>"


df <- data.frame(lat = 40.455, lng = -4.82)
df %>% leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = navIcon, popup = navSite)
```
