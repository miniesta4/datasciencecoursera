## US economic time series

```{r economics}

ec <- economics
ec$unemp_rate <- round(100 * (ec$unemploy / ec$pop), 2)

y <- list(title = "Rate - Weeks")

plot_ly(ec, x = ~date, y = ~psavert, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", name = "Personal savings rate") %>%
  add_trace(y = ~uempmed, name = "Median duration of unemployment (weeks)") %>%
  add_trace(y = ~unemp_rate, name = "Unemployment rate") %>%
   layout(legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 0.95), yaxis = y)
```
